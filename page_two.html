    <h1>Causes</h1>

   <p class="coal"><img src="/climate images/coal plant.jpg" class="coal" width="600px" height="350px">
    FOSSIL FUELS: Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest contributers to climate change. Coal, oil and gases all release large amounts
    of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. These greenhouse gases will then trap all the heat from the
    sun in the atmosphere. Slowly causing global warming

    <p class="fracking"><img src="/climate images/gas-fracking-freezeframe-shutterstock_1050825092.jpg" class="fracking" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
    FRACKING: Fracking and big fracking indsutry is also a huge contributer to climate change. Fracking much like burning fossil
    fuels, releases gases into the air. In this case its methane, a common greenhouse gas. Fracking causes air
    pollution, and injects chemicals into the ground which contributes to water pollution as well.

    <p class="deforestation"><img src="/climate images/gryffyn-m-axE5o1Xh7_Q-unsplash (1)-1.jpg" class="deforestation" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
    DEFORESTATION: Trees are a big safeguard against the release of Carbon Dioxide into the air. Deforesttation gets ride of that safeguard
    and the carbon dioxide released is allowed to freely enter our atmosphere. Not only that deforestation, can decreases
    temperatures and without trees, there is higher temperatures. Which in turn causes more forest fires, and the cycle repeats.
